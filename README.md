## Ind_Project_README-Generator
### Independent (personal) project in which I automatically generate README files for each of my repositories from my coursework
    
## Summary
Creating README files for each of my repositories I could have handled manually, but I thought it would speed things up if I typed out just the summaries and applied a Python script to pull out the inforamtion I had already collected about each and put in a spreadsheet and then mapped this to the folder structure I had utilzied on my harddrive for saving project files.  I had to create dataframes from both the data I had collected and the folders, which meant using the pandas read_excel method as well as the pathlib Path objects to be able to read and write files.
